- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @La-Hai-Nam from Berlin, Germany

I'm currently working on setting up my repositories which I have made over 2 years of studying as well as add more projects in the coming future. As most of my projects for college so far have been made on a private Gitlab server I'm migrating already finished projects.
